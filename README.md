# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Seismic Monitor

The purpose of this project is to visualize an earthquake data set from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet. There are two levels in the scope of this project:
### Level 1: Basic Visualization - Import and Visualize the Data
Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. 
The data API endpoint used from the USGS GeoJSON Feed Page is 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. Popups are included to provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. A legend is provided to give context for the data. 
### Level 2: More Data - Add a second data set on the map (optional)
Plot a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 
Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out the two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently. Add layer controls to the map.
